const int analogInPin = A0;  // Analog input pin that the potentiometer is attached to
const int analogOutPin = 9;  // Analog output pin that the LED is attached to
const int digitalLoMinusPin = 12;  // Analog input pin that the potentiometer is attached to
const int digitalLoPlusPin = 14;  // Analog input pin that the potentiometer is attached to
